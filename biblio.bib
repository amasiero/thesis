  abstract	= "To enable situated human--robot interaction (HRI), an
		  autonomous robot must both understand and control
		  proxemics---the social use of space---to employ natural
		  communication mechanisms analogous to those used by humans.
		  This work presents a computational framework of proxemics
		  based on data-driven probabilistic models of how social
		  signals (speech and gesture) are produced (by a human) and
		  perceived (by a robot). The framework and models were
		  implemented as autonomous proxemic behavior systems for
		  sociable robots, including: (1) a sampling-based method for
		  robot proxemic goal state estimation with respect to
		  human--robot distance and orientation parameters, (2) a
		  reactive proxemic controller for goal state realization,
		  and (3) a cost-based trajectory planner for maximizing
		  automated robot speech and gesture recognition rates along
		  a path to the goal state. Evaluation results indicate that
		  the goal state estimation and realization significantly
		  improve upon past work in human--robot proxemics with
		  respect to ``interaction potential''---predicted automated
		  speech and gesture recognition rates as the robot enters
		  into and engages in face-to-face social encounters with a
		  human user---illustrating their efficacy to support richer
		  robot perception and autonomy in HRI.",

		  is necessary to create clusters in order to identify
		  features to be explored by the project designer. In
		  general, a classical clustering algorithm called K-Means is
		  used to group users features. However, K-Means reveals some
		  problems during the cluster process. In fact, K-Means does
		  not guarantee to find Quality-Preserved Sets (QPS) and its
		  randomness let the entire process unpredictable and
		  unstable. In order to avoid these problems, a novel
		  algorithm called Q-SIM (Quality Similarity Clustering) is
		  presented in this paper. The Q-SIM algorithm has the
		  objective to keep a similarity degree among all elements
		  inside the cluster and guarantee QPS for all sets. During
		  the tests, Q-SIM demonstrates that it is better than
		  k-means and it is more appropriate to solve the problem for
		  user modeling presented in this paper.",

		  interlocutors' multimodal signals seem to correlate with
		  the user's experience and impressions of the interaction.
		  We explored in more detail how some aspects of multimodal
		  behaviour (gazing, facial expressions, body posture) can
		  predict the user's evaluation of the robot's behaviour
		  (Responsiveness, Expressiveness, Interface, Usability,
		  Overall impression). The results indicate that the user's
		  assessment concerning the evaluation categories Interface
		  and Usability, and to some extent the categories
		  Expressiveness and Overall correlate with their behaviour
		  in a statistically significant manner. The work contributes
		  to our understanding of how the interlocutors' engagement
		  and active participation relate to their assessment of the
		  success of communication, and points towards automating
		  evaluation of human-robot interactions.",
